 **[PCU.10000]** Input 120 VDC

+The PCU shall operate nominally given a steady-state voltage between 102 VDC and 126.5 VDC on the Operational Power input in accordance with LASP Document No. 154920.  
 
 - Rationale: *The PCU converts the 120 VDC Operational Power supplied by the ExPA into 28 VDC. Document No. 154920 identifies the pins, part number, manufacturer, and description of the 120V Power Input interface jack and mating connector.  This derives from the ELC 120 VDC Power Interface requirements of section E.3.2.1.1.1 of SSP 57003 Rev L. Figure E.3.2.1.1.2-1 implies that the PCU could see a minimum of 102 VDC.*

+The PCU shall operate nominally after exposure to input voltages from 0 to 102 VDC (TBR).
 
 - Rationale: *The PCU needs to be resilient to times when the ELC may provide less voltage than the advertised nominal value.* 
-- Comments: **What is the LASP rationale for this requirement? Given the nominal input voltage range of 102V-126.5V, the brownout range cannot be all the way up to 120V. It seems like there should be more specifics to account for a particular condition. How does LASP want LaRC to verify this requirement?**  
+
+- LASP 30APR2018 comment: "The rationale for the requirement derives from engineering best practices, to ensure that the PCU continues to operate after exposure to voltages less than the minimum nominal voltage of 102VDC. Exposure to lower voltage might result in high current draw which could damage or stress components within the PCU. "
