# Introduction #

## Purpose and Scope ##

This document establishes the PCU requirements, which specify the subsystem that converts 120 VDC Operational Power to 28 VDC power suitable for the other CPRSP subsystems.

## Document Organization ##

`\autoref{sec_docs}`{=latex} lists applicable and reference documents. `\autoref{conops}`{=latex} provides the PCU concept of operations. `\autoref{interfaces}`{=latex} discusses the external interfaces and boundaries of the PCU. `\autoref{sec_req}`{=latex} contains the technical requirements. Appendix A defines acronyms.

## Document Control ##

This document is managed by the CPF Project and, after initial approval, will be placed under configuration control using the change management processes defined in the CLARREO Pathfinder Configuration Management Operating Procedure (CPF-01-005).

## Order of Precedence ##

The Program-Level Requirements and Project-Level plans listed in the applicable documents section take precedence over the PCU ICD. Nothing in this document, however, supersedes applicable laws and regulations.

# Concept of Operations [conops] #

The Power Converter Unit is a part of the CPRSP, along with the HISIE, HPS, HySICS Instrument, and ExPA. The PCU's primary role is to convert 120 VDC Operational Power provided by the ELC to 28 VDC Power to service the remaining elements of the CPRSP when the discrete data input is activated.

The PCU operates in a host of different scenarios during its lifetime from integration through disposal. Following assembly, the PCU completes functional and environmental testing at LaRC.

The PCU is shipped to LASP, where it is functionally tested with the CPRSP subsystems other than the the ExPA (`\TBR{Delivery destination and role of PCU in CPRSP testing}`{=latex}). The 28 VDC output of the PCU is connected to the HISIE and HPS via three buses and connect 120 VDC and discrete data test lines to the PCU's input ports. The PCU provides analog signal and thermistor outputs to enable troubleshooting and monitoring of PCU operations during CPRSP testing at LASP, all other ground testing, and on-orbit operations. The PCU may be used during thermal vacuum chamber testing. As a programmatic alternative to integration with the other CPRSP elements at LASP, the PCU may travel directly from LaRC to Kennedy Space Center for subsequent CPRSP integration.

After completion of the testing at KSC, the PCU remains unpowered until the CPRSP is attached to ELC-1. During installation when the CPRSP is attached to the EOTP, the discrete is not asserted, and the PCU does not draw power from the EOTP. 

Following installation, the PCU power is nominally enabled by ISS controllers performing two actions. The first action is activating the 120 VDC Operational Power bus, allowing that power to flow via the J1 port on the ExPA. The relay's switch is normally open and closes only when the discrete data line is activated. The second action is activating the commanding discrete, at which point the PCU energizes the voltage conversion circuitry to output 28 VDC. 

When either the 120 VDC Operational Power is removed or the discrete data line is deactivated, the PCU ceases outputting 28 VDC power. When science operations are complete or for other scenarios requiring planned deactivation of the PCU, the nominal order of controller operations for de-energizing the PCU is deactivating the commanding discrete, followed by deactivating the 120 VDC Operational Power bus. In the event of an unplanned power outage of the 120 VDC Operational Bus, controllers deactivate the commanding discrete as soon as possible if power had not yet been restored. Both planned and unplanned power outages remove all power to the CPRSP.

# External Interfaces [interfaces] #

## External Interfaces by Function

The PCU maintains external interfaces across the following functions: 

- Structural
	- ExPA Attachment
- Power
	- 28V Power Output
		- 28 VDC Bus A Power Out
		- 28 VDC Bus B Power Out
		- 28 VDC Bus C Power Out
	- 120V Power Input
- Data or signal
	- Analog Signals / Thermistor Output
		- Thermistor Out x 6
		- Bus A Current Analog Out
		- Bus B Current Analog Out
		- Bus C Current Analog Out
		- Bus Voltage Analog Out
- Thermal
	- ExPA Heat Rejection
	- Survival Heaters (`\TBR{Pending thermal analysis of whether survival heaters are necessary for PCU}`{=latex})
	- Adaptor Plate (`\TBR{Pending thermal analysis of whether there is thermal interface with Adaptor Plate}`{=latex})
- Command
	- Discrete Enable Input

## External Interface Boundaries

`\autoref{boundaries}`{=latex} shows the boundaries between each of the external interfaces. The External Subsystem identifies the subsystem to which the PCU shares an interface. CPRSP ancillary refers to hardware that is not yet specifically allocated to CPRSP subsystems, generally the wiring harnesses in the context of the PCU. The PCU Items belong to, and will be delivered with the PCU. The External Items belong to the External Subsystem, and the PCU design assumes their presence and availability for connection. LASP Document Number 154920 provides specific pinout information on the interfaces with the CPRSP ancillary external item.
