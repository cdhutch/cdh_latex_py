## Accepts 120 VDC Input  

**[PCU.10000]** Input 120 VDC  

The PCU shall operate nominally given a steady-state voltage between 106.5 VDC and 126.5 VDC on the Operational Power input in accordance with LASP Document No. 154920.  

- Rationale: *The PCU converts the 120 VDC Operational Power supplied by the ExPA into 28 VDC. Document No. 154920 identifies the pins, part number, manufacturer, and description of the 120V Power Input interface jack and mating connector.  This derives from the ELC 120 VDC Power Interface requirements of section E.3.2.1.1.1 of SSP 57003 Rev L. Figure E.3.2.1.1.2-1 implies that the PCU could see a minimum of 102 VDC.* 

**[PCU.10005]** Exposure to Brownout  

The PCU shall operate nominally after exposure to input voltages from 0 to 120 VDC during brownout.  

- Rationale: *The PCU needs to be resilient to times when the ELC may provide less voltage than the advertised nominal value.* 
- Comments: **What is the LASP rationale for this requirement? Given the nominal input voltage range of 102V-126.5V, the brownout range cannot be all the way up to 120V. It seems like there should be more specifics to account for a particular condition. How does LASP want LaRC to verify this requirement?**  

**[PCU.10010]** Survival Following Unannounced Removal of Power  

The PCU shall survive after exposure to an unplanned removal of power.  

- Rationale: *The PCU needs to be resilient to times when the ISS removes 120V Operational Power from the ELC prior to notifying the CPOC due to operational constraints.* 

**[PCU.10015]** Protection from Input Polarity Reversal  

The PCU shall protect itself from damage due to reversed polarity at the PCU 120 VDC input.  

- Rationale: *During integration and test, there is a possibility that technicians may attach the wrong connectors to the 120 VDC inputs, and the PCU design need to accommodate this situation.* 

**[PCU.10020]** 120 VDC Non-Normal Voltage Transients  

The PCU shall operate nominally following exposure to transient voltage conditions as specified by SSP 57003 Rev L Figure E.3.2.1.1.2-1.  

- Rationale: *This requirement protects the ISS in the event of a transient voltage condition. Loads may be exposed to transient overvoltage conditions during operation of the power system's fault protection components.  This derives from the ELC 120 VDC Power Interface requirements of section E.3.2.1.1.2 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.10025]** Reverse Current  

The PCU shall limit reverse current transients in accordance with Figures E.3.2.1.1.4-1, E.3.2.1.1.4-2, E.3.2.1.1.4-3 of SSP 57003 Rev L  when exposed to a hard fault across the power source, as specified by section E.3.2.1.1.4 of SSP 57003 Rev L.   

- Rationale: *This requirement prevents current from entering an output and damaging components. For purposes of this interface definition, the fault is 10 milliohms or less applied within 2 micro-seconds or less. For the ELC Payload/payload exhibiting reverse current transient peaks within +/-100 Amperes, the fault resistance is 40 milliohms or less.  This derives from the ELC 120 VDC Power Interface requirements of section E.3.2.1.1.4 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.10030]** 120 VDC Operational Power Ripple Voltage and Noise  

The PCU shall operate and be compatible with the EPS time domain ripple voltage and noise level of 2.5 Vrms maximum within the frequency range of 30 Hz to 1 MH when connected to 120 VDC Operational Power.  

- Rationale: *This requirement precludes damage to ExPCA and ORUs. Derives from the ELC 120 VDC Power Interface requirements of section E.3.2.1.1.6.2 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.10035]** 120 VDC Operational Power Ripple Voltage Spectrum  

The PCU, connected to ELC 120 VDC output, shall operate and be compatible with the EPS ripple voltage spectrum of a maximum as shown in SSP 57003 Rev L Figure E.3.2.1.1.6.3-1.  

- Rationale: *This requirement precludes damage to ExPCA and ORUs. Note: This limit is 6 decibels (dB) below the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) CS-01, 02 requirement in SSP 30237, Space Station Requirements for Electromagnetic Emission and Susceptibility Requirements, up to 30 MHz.    Derives from the ELC 120 VDC Power Interface requirements of section E.3.2.1.1.6.3 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.10040]** 120 VDC Operational Power Surge Current  

The PCU shall limit in-rush current at power input connected to ELC 120 VDC output interface in accordance with Table E.3.2.1.1.6.4-1 of SSP 57003 Rev L.  

- Rationale: *This requirement prevents a hazard due to circuit overload. Derives from the ELC 120 VDC Power Interface requirements of section E.3.2.1.1.6.4 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

## Accepts Discretes  

**[PCU.11000]** Input Discrete Power-on Command  

The PCU shall recognize a digital logic zero (VIL) and digital logic one (VIH) for +5 V or +28 V `\TBR{Voltage of Discrete Input Signals}`{=latex} logic levels from the ExPCA as defined in Table L.3.7.4.1.1-1, Discrete Output Logic Levels, between the payload input pins.  

- Rationale: *The discrete signal conveys the power on command to the PCU. Document No. 154920 identifies the pins, part number, manufacturer, and description of the Discrete Enable Input interface jack and mating connector.  Derives from Discrete Output Logic Levels (from ExPCA) requirements of section L.3.7.4.1.1 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.11005]** Output Power with Discrete Present  

The PCU shall activate its output voltage when the discrete Power-on signal is logic one and when 120 VDC is applied to the PCU input.  

- Rationale: *The PCU output power is normally off and enabled when the discrete signal is present (logic one).* 

**[PCU.11010]** No Output Power without Discrete  

The PCU shall cease outputting power when the discrete Power-on  signal is logic zero.  

- Rationale: *The PCU output power is normally off and only enabled when the discrete signal is present (logic one). This prevents the PCU from drawing a significant load unless the CPRSP is attached to the ELC and commanded on by the CPOC.* 

**[PCU.11015]** Discrete Returns  

The PCU shall provide an individual return for each ISS low level discrete signal.  

- Rationale: *A dedicated return ensures that return currents are routed with supply leads, thus minimizing radiation due to differential mode currents and aids in crosstalk reduction.  Not sharing returns minimizes the chances of common impedance noise coupling. This derives from the Analog, Differential Circuit Return requirement in section 3.2.3.3.2.6 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.11020]** Discrete Loading - Capacitance  

The PCU shall prevent the maximum capacitive loading on the ExPA discrete outputs from exceeding 1 microFarad.  

- Rationale: *This requirement ensures that discrete signals (including those used to control a hazard) are received. This derives from the Payload Discrete Loading Requirements  in section L.3.7.4.6.A of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.11025]** Discrete Loading - Inductance  

The PCU shall prevent the maximum inductive loading the ExPA discrete outputs from exceeding 10mH.  

- Rationale: *This requirement ensures that discrete signals (including those used to control a hazard) are received. This derives from the Payload Discrete Loading Requirements  in section L.3.7.4.6.A of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.11031]** Discrete Loading - Resistance 28 V  

The PCU shall ensure that the maximum resistive loading on the ExPCA +28V discrete output exceeds 700 Ohm, except for when used for switch closure detection.  

- Rationale: *This requirement ensures that discrete signals (including those used to control a hazard) are received. The ExPCA discrete output voltage span of +28 Vdc +2.6/-4.0 Vdc is not guaranteed when loading exceeds 35mA (current-limiting will occur with FRAM-based Payload loads drawing about 35 mA). This derives from the Payload Discrete Loading Requirements  in section L.3.7.4.6.B of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

## Outputs 28 VDC  

**[PCU.12000]** Output 28 VDC  

The PCU shall output 28 VDC Power nominal on three power buses in accordance with LASP Document No. 154920.

**[PCU.12015]** Maximum Output Ripple Voltage  

The PCU shall output a DC voltage with a peak-to-peak ripple voltage less than or equal to 400 mV.  

- Rationale: *Aref Nammari, Lead EE for CLARREO at LASP, stated in a 24 OCT 2017 e-mail, "Ripple of <= 500mV is reasonable and should work: I will take a closer look at DC-DC converters to confirm but I don't think there would be a problem."* 
- Comments: **Request more detailed rationale from LASP.**  

**[PCU.12020]** Minimum Output Power  

The PCU shall output electrical power greater than or equal to 20 W.  

- Rationale: *This requirement serves as the minumum expected load from the CPRSP. It does not mean that the PCU must have a minimum load. Aref Nammari, Lead EE for CLARREO at LASP, agreed to this value in in 24OCT2017 e-mail.* 

## Outputs Analog Signals  

**[PCU.13000]** Output Analog Signals  

The PCU shall output thermistor and analog signals in accordance with LASP Document No. 154920.  

- Rationale: *The PCU transmits engineering data for diagnostic testing via a set of analog lines. Document No. 154920 identifies the pins, part number, manufacturer, and description of the Analog Signals / Thermistor Output interface jack and mating connector.* 

**[PCU.13005]** Transmit Bus A Current Signal

- Rationale: *Transmitting the Bus B current to the HISIE enables CPOC monitoring and troubleshooting of the PCU.* 

**[PCU.13015]** Transmit Bus C Current Signal  

The PCU shall transmit the Bus C current telemetry via an analog signal.   

- Rationale: *Transmitting the Bus C current to the HISIE enables CPOC monitoring and troubleshooting of the PCU.* 

**[PCU.13018]** Transmit Bus Output Voltage Signal  

The PCU shall transmit the bus output voltage telemetry via an analog signal.  

- Rationale: *Transmitting the output voltage to the HISIE enables CPOC monitoring and troubleshooting of the PCU* 

**[PCU.13020]** Thermistor Output  

The PCU shall transmit six internal temperatures to the HISIE using no more than six thermistors.  

- Rationale: *The thermistors provide the HISIE information into PCU internal temperatures, which may constrain certain operations of the PCU.* 

## Provides Current Protection  

**[PCU.14000]** Bus A Maximum Current  

The PCU shall fuse Bus A to 10 amperes `\TBR{Value of Bus A maximum current}`{=latex}.

**[PCU.14003]** Bus B Maximum Current  

The PCU shall fuse Bus B to 7.5 amperes `\TBR{Value of Bus B maximum current}`{=latex}.

The PCU shall output electrical power to Bus C with a power less than or equal to 168 W.  

- Rationale: *Bus C powers the gimbal motors, and the value is provided by Aref Nammari during meeting on 07FEB2018.* 

**[PCU.14020]** Circuit Protection Trip Coordination  

The PCU shall provide trip coordination such that sub-system over-current protection nearest to the fault will activate prior to over-current protection further upstream.  

- Rationale: *This requirement ensures operability of the CPRSP without tripping upstream protection devices. This derives from the Electrical Power System Circuit Protection Characteristics requirements in section 3.2.2.A of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.14025]** Circuit Protection for Overcurrent  

The PCU shall provide overcurrent protection at all points where power is distributed to lower level feeder and branch lines as specified by Tables 3.2.2-3, 3.2.2-4, 3.2.2-5, 3.2.2-6, and 3.2.2-7 of  SSP 57003 Rev L.  

- Rationale: *This requirement prevents overload of wiring within the CPRSP. This derives from section 3.2.2.B of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.14100]** EOTP Current Draw  

The PCU shall not draw current from the EOTP.  

- Rationale: *The EOTH electrical interface is only defined for resistive heater power loads. Non-resistive electrical logs, *e.g.* motors, computers, capacitors, *etc.*, are not supported by the EOTP. Payloads must have inhibits in place for all non-resistive electrical loads such that no power is being drawn from the EOTP power buses when they are energized (SSP 57003, 3.7.3.5.3). ExPA-based Payloads need to be aware that the EOTP Primary Heater Power (120 VDC Bus 1) use the same lines as the ELC operational power lines. Note that the EOTP has no command or telemetry for payloads.* 

## Matches Impedance  

**[PCU.15000]** Downstream Impedance  

The PCU shall output power compatible with the specified load impedance model.  

- Rationale: *The PCU design accounts for a stable impedance interface between the load and the source across frequencies of interest. Load impedance model is from LTspice model with filename `CPRS_PWR_input_impedance_NO_PCU.asc` delivered by LASP on 21 February 2018.* 
- Comments: **Request that LASP place LTspice model under configuration control and provide a reference to which requirement can refer.**  

## Isolates DC Power  

**[PCU.15100]** Payload Power Isolation  

The PCU shall isolate its DC power  from chassis, structure, equipment conditioned power return/reference, and signal returns by a minimum of 1 MegaOhm.  

- Rationale: *The 120 VDC or 28 VDC source is referenced to structure at its output.  The payload power input must be isolated to prevent ground loops and intentional current flow through structure. This derives from the Payload  Power Isolation requirements in section 3.2.3.3.1 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.15105]** Single Point Ground  

The PCU shall connect each electrically isolated power source to the structure at no more than one point.  

- Rationale: *A single reference to structure prevents the flow of intentional and noise currents which could have an adverse impact on ISS and other equipment operations. This derives from the Single Point Ground requirement in section 3.2.3.3.2.1 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.15110]** Electrical Power Isolation  

The PCU shall isolate each isolated electrical DC power source from chassis, structure, equipment-conditioned power return/reference, and signal circuits by a minimum of 1 MegaOhm, individually, except at the single point ground.  

- Rationale: *A single reference to structure prevents the flow of intentional and noise currents which could have an adverse impact on ISS and other equipment operations. This derives from the Electrical Power Isolation requirements in section 3.2.3.3.2.2 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.15115]** Signal Circuit Return Grounding  

The PCU shall DC isolate circuit conductors from chassis, structure, and equipment conditioned power return/reference, by a minimum of 1 MegaOhm, individually, when not terminated by the signal circuit's single point ground/reference.  

- Rationale: *A single reference to structure prevents the flow of intentional and noise currents which could have an adverse impact on ISS and other equipment operations. Balanced, differential circuits isolated from chassis, structure, and user conditioned power return/reference by a minimum of 6000 ohms complies with this requirement.    Note: Signals circuits with frequency components equal to or above four megahertz may use controlled impedance transmission and reception media such as (but not limited to):  - shielded twisted 72 ohm cable - "twin ax" cable balanced and referenced to primary structure at a single point - "triax" cable using the center and inner shield conductors for unbalanced transmission, referenced to primary structure at a single point with the outer shield multipoint grounded as an "overshield". - "coax" cable with the shield terminated 360 degrees at each end and at available intermediate point (permitted for signals with the lowest frequency component equal to or above 4 MHz).    This derives from the Signal Circuit Returning Grounding requirement in section 3.2.3.3.2.3 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.15120]** Analog, Differential Circuit Return  

The PCU shall provide a separate return for each differential analog circuit.  

- Rationale: *A dedicated return ensures that return currents are routed with supply leads, thus minimizing radiation due to differential mode currents and aids in crosstalk reduction.  Not sharing returns minimizes the chances of common impedance noise coupling. This derives from the Analog, Differential Circuit Return requirement in section 3.2.3.3.2.5 of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

## Structural  

**[PCU.16000]** Mass Limit  

The PCU shall have a mass less than or equal to 8.77 kg.

**[PCU.16010]** Output Connector Location  

The PCU shall have output connectors along its `-X` face in the ExPA Reference Coordinate System.  

- Rationale: *This is an interpretation of a drawing that Aref Nammari, Lead EE for CLARREO at LASP, sent in 24OCT2017 e-mail. Reference: D683-97497-01 Revision E.* 

**[PCU.16015]** Connector Types

**[PCU.16030]** Dimension in Z axis  

The PCU shall be less than 2.3 inches along the `Z`-axis in the ExPA Reference Coordinate System.

**[PCU.16105]** PCU Positioning on ExPA  

The PCU shall comply with LASP interface drawing `\TBD{Drawing from LASP showing PCU positioning on ExPA}`{=latex}.  

- Rationale: *This drawing shows how the PCU should be positioned on ExPA to ensure interface compatibility with the rest of the CPRSP.* 
- Comments: **Request LASP provide a drawing specifying any positioning constraints for PCU on ExPA.**  

**[PCU.16110]** Threaded Fasteners with Locking Features  

The PCU shall use threaded fasteners that implement locking features.

- Rationale: *This requirement prevents molecular deposition on ISS and other payloads. Derives from External Contamination Requirements of section 3.5.3.2.A of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.16210]** Molecular Deposition onto ISS Elements  

The PCU shall limit cumulative contaminant deposit on ISS elements, using the nominal operating temperature of the contamination source materials (emitters) and nominal operating temperatures of other Payloads (receivers), to less than  `\TBD{Molecular Deposition onto Other ISS Elements Limit}`{=latex} g/cm^2/s.

**[PCU.16220]** Visible Clean-Sensitive  

The PCU shall have visibly clean external surfaces at an incident light level of at least 50 foot-candles and at a distance of 2 to 4 feet.

**[PCU.16425]** Minimum Natural Frequency  

The PCU shall have a minimum natural frequency of 250 Hz `\TBR{Minimum Natural Frequency}`{=latex}.  

- Rationale: *Setting a minimum natural frequency above that expected to be encountened prevents the PCU from experiencing induced resonance. Requirement levied by LASP via spreadsheet dated 05MAR2018.*

- Rationale: *LASP original: "PCU shall be designed to maintain positive structural margins of safety when exposed to the loading induced by plate deformations in bending"* 
- Comments: **Request clarification and rationale from LASP.**  

**[PCU.16440]** Pressure Decay Rate during Launch  

The PCU shall maintain positive structural margins of safety when exposed to a pressure decay rate of 0.4 lb/in^2 per second.  

- Rationale: *The PCU needs to maintain structural integrity in an environment of decreasing of local atmospheric pressure during launch. This decay rate is comprehensive and envelopes low and high fill factors. This is derived from requirement SPX-FRAM-030-REQ from section 2.5.9 of the Dragon FRAM Payloads Interface Requirements Document (SPX-0003603, version 3.0)* 

**[PCU.16445]** Pressure Decay Rate during Launch Transonic Regime  

The PCU shall maintain positive structural margins of safety when exposed to a pressure decay rate of 1.0  lb/in^2 per second for a duration of 7.0 seconds.  

- Rationale: *The PCU needs to maintain structural integrity in an environment of decreasing of local atmospheric pressure during launch. This decay rate is comprehensive and envelopes low and high fill factors. This is derived from requirement SPX-FRAM-030-REQ from section 2.5.9 of the Dragon FRAM Payloads Interface Requirements Document (SPX-0003603, version 3.0)* 

## Thermal  

**[PCU.17000]** Thermal Mass  

The PCU thermal mass shall be 4475 +/- `\TBD{Tolerance of thermal mass}`{=latex} J/K.  

- Rationale: *CPRSP subsystem designs are based on their equivalent subsystems from TSIS, which interfaced with the EPIC converter. This requirement simplifies the thermal analysis of the CPRSP element interfaces with the PCU. Aref Nammari, Lead EE for CLARREO at LASP, stated in a 24 OCT 2017 e-mail, "We would like the thermal mass of the covert to be the same as EPIC which was about 4475 J/deg C"* 
- Comments: **Ask LASP for a reasonable range of thermal mass and a technical rationale.**

**[PCU.18100]** Allowable Flight Temperature  

The PCU shall operate nominally between the temperatures -30 deg C and +50 deg C, measured at the mounting surface.  

- Rationale: *This represented the expected temperature regime on orbit in which the PCU needs to function.* 
- Comments: **Ask LASP for the rationale for the -30 to +50 values.**  

**[PCU.18105]** Non-Operational Survival Temperature  

The PCU shall survive temperatures of -50 deg C to +75 deg C, measured at the mounting surface.  

- Rationale: *This represented the expected temperature regime on orbit to which the PCU may be exposed to and subsequently operate when returned to the allowable flight temperature.* 
- Comments: **Ask LASP for the rationale for the -50 to +75 values.**  

**[PCU.18110]** Total Ionizing Dose  

The PCU shall operate nominally while exposed to the total ionizing dose levels as specified by SSP 30512.  

- Rationale: *The design of the PCU needs to account for the expected radiation in its operational environment, which could threaten its operations.* 

**[PCU.18115]** Trapped Electron Exposure  

The PCU shall operate nominally while exposed to the trappeed electron flux levels as specified by SSP 30512.  

- Rationale: *The design of the PCU needs to account for the expected radiation in its operational environment, which could threaten its operations.* 

**[PCU.18120]** Trapped Proton Exposure  

The PCU shall operate nominally while exposed to the trappeed proton flux levels as specified by SSP 30512.  

- Rationale: *The design of the PCU needs to account for the expected radiation in its operational environment, which could threaten its operations.* 

**[PCU.18125]** Single Event Upset  

The PCU shall operate nominally without sustaining permanent damage following exposure to single event upsets as specified by SSP 30512.  

- Rationale: *The design of the PCU needs to account for the expected radiation in its operational environment, which could threaten its operations.* 

**[PCU.18130]** Single Event Latchup  

The PCU shall operate nominally without sustaining  damage following exposure to single event latchup events as specified by SSP 30512.  

- Rationale: *The design of the PCU needs to account for the expected radiation in its operational environment, which could threaten its operations.* 

**[PCU.18135]** Material Breakdown Voltages  

The PCU shall incorporate materials, including surface coatings, with breakdown voltages in excess of +20/-80 volts on all components directly exposed to the plasma environment.  

- Rationale: *This requirement protects the ISS and EVA crewmembers from electrostatic discharges and prevents arcing. This derives from Plasma requirements of section 3.5.4.1A of SSP 57003 Rev L.* 

**[PCU.18200]** Structural Analysis/Design Factors of Safety  

The PCU shall comply with the structural analysis and design factors of safety, as defined in GSFC-STD-7000A.  

- Rationale: *GSFC-STD-7000A contains environmental verification standards for space flight hardware.* 

**[PCU.18205]** EEE Minimum Workmanship Vibroacoustic Test Levels  

The PCU shall meet minimum workmanship test levels specified by Section 2.4.2.5 of GSFC-STD-7000A.  

- Rationale: *Section 2.4.2.5 of GSFC-STD-7000A is Compoment/Unit Vibroacoustic Tests section of GEVS* 

## EMI/EMC  

**[PCU.19005]** Conducted Susceptibility (CS06) Limits  

The PCU shall prevent any malfunction, degradation of performance, or deviation that exceeds tolerances when subjected to test spikes , in accordance with  Figure 3.2.4.2.3-1 of SSP 57003 Rev L, applied to DC power input leads.  

- Rationale: *This requirement is to ensure that payload equipment does not experience damage or degraded performance when subjected to transients that may be expected on the power bus. Longer duration transients are covered by power quality requirements. Note: CS06 is applicable to dc power leads of equipment and subsystem powered by 120 Vdc sources, including grounds and returns, which are not grounded internally to the equipment or subsystem. (From SSP 30237, 3.2.2.3)    Note: Both the positive and negative spike will be applied to each lead under test. Each spike will be applied one time per lead instead of multiple spikes over the course of two minutes.  This derives from the Conducted Susceptibility (CS06) Limits requirements in section 3.2.4.2.3 of SSP 57003 Rev L* 

**[PCU.19105]** Shock Hazard - Class H, Static Bond - Class S  

The PCU shall comply with the coating requirement for mating surfaces, such that the mechanical bonding surface between the PCU and the ExPA is conductive (conversion coated) to MIL-DTL-5541 class 3 Type 1 (SSP 30245 Revision P).
