## Mission Requirements  
### Space Segment Requirements  

**[RS.21000]** Wavelength  

The CPRSP wavelength range for the instrument shall be 350 - 2300 nm.  

- Rationale: *Values cover the range needed to observe changes in clouds, cloud phase, water vapor, aerosol, and land surface features.  The upper limit is chosen due to loss of signal from reduced solar irradiance and strong water vapor and carbon dioxide absorption at longer wavelengths.  The wavelength limits are chosen to provide sufficient spectral range for accurate intercalibration of the CERES broadband shortwave channels. Reference: Wu et al., 2015.*  
- Verification Method: Test  
- Verification Description: LASP will test the instrument by generating optical signals to stimulate every channel across the wavelength range.

- Verification Method: Analysis  
- Verification Description: LASP will analyze the contribution of measured CPRSP pointing errors when viewing the Sun and Moon.  
- Success Criteria: The verification will be successful when the contribution of pointing errors does not exceed the budget allocation associated with RS.21004 and RS.21005.

- Rationale: *To limit inter-calibration noise due to differences in viewing-zenith angles in HySICS and Inter-Calibration Instrument measurements. Wielicki et al., IGARSS 2008, specifies that at a point on Earth's surface within the Inter-Calibration Instrument's field of view, the viewing-zenith angles to that instrument and to HySICS should not differ by more than 1 degree.  Measurements at the HySICS boresight meet this constraint when the boresight is aimed within 0.7 degrees of the time-varying line of sight. Reference CPF-SER-008.*  
- Verification Method: Analysis  
- Verification Description: LASP will analyze the CPRSP's ability to track the lines of sight representative of a set of inter-calibration event geometries by programming the lines of sight and commanding the CPRSP to track them.  
- Success Criteria: The verification will be successful when the error between the Inter-Calibration Instrument line of sight and the HySICS Instrument boresight is less than 0.7 degrees (k=1) throughout the inter-calibration event.

**[RS.21025]** Along-track FOV  

The CPRSP shall measure RS radiation continuously along-track with a field of view less than or equal to 0.5 km at nadir.  

- Rationale: *This requirement is driven by the uncertainty budget for inter-calibration to limit noise from spatial data mapping, and the emphasis is gapless coverage along track. The actual instrument angular FOV, pixel size, and array geometry can be derived from this as well as the ISS altitude.*  
- Verification Method: Inspection  
- Verification Description: LASP will inspect the CPRSP design to determine the FOV at ISS altitude.  
- Success Criteria: The verification will be successful when the along-track field of view of the CPRSP is less than or equal to 0.5 km.

- Verification Method: Analysis  
- Verification Description: LASP will analyze the CPRSP sampling rate at ISS altitude to determine the distance between resolved pixels.  
- Success Criteria: The verification will be successful when the distance between two pixels is 0.5 km or less.

- Rationale: *This requirement ensures that the uncertainty contribution form instrument sensitivity to polarization is limited. Simulations were carried out to determine the distribution of spectrally dependent polarization using global PARASOL multi-angle, multi-spectral polarization measurements. The data were used to simulate the polarization distributions across a full range of scene conditions and climate regions that CLARREO would see for its nadir reflectance spectra, as well as for the scattering angles that it would use to provide Reference Intercalibration to CERES or RBI and VIIRS.  Reference: Lukashin et al., 2013.*  
- Verification Method: Test  
- Verification Description: LASP will test the difference in response of the CPRSP to a polarized signal versus a non-polarized signal.

- Rationale: *This enables sufficient inter-calibration sampling with instruments flying in JPSS-like orbits. The reference is to the ISS body axes instead of the ISS ground track, due to the contribution of ISS attitude excursions to ground-referenced lines of sight. Reference: MCR Inter-Calibration Approach presentation (Section 10.0).*

The CPRSP shall have sufficient pointing knowledge such that the CSDS can determine the Earth viewing pixel geolocation to within 250 m (k=1) nadir equivalent.  

- Rationale: *This enables the CSDS to generate geolocated data at a precision of 250 m, which is one half of a single pixel's footprint; maintaining this performance ensures that the target point falls within the pixel's actual footprint. This limits the inter-calibration noise due to spatial difference over the viewed scene.  Reference: Wielicki et al., IGARSS 2008*  
- Verification Method: Analysis  
- Verification Description: LASP will verify by analysis.

An Inter-Calibration operation is defined as one of the following:- - Measurement of spectral reflectance over entire lunar disk- - Inter-Calibration of space-borne instruments in low Earth orbit (LEO)- - Inter-Calibration of space-borne instruments in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) - - Characterization of land site  

- Rationale: *To ensure that there will be adequate pointing capability in the HPS to perform all of the Inter-Calibration operations during the mission life. The intent of this requirement is that if there is an opportunity for an Inter-Calibration measurement during an orbit, the CPRSP should be able to acquire the data. This requirement in not intended to drive the CPRSP to add additional hardware.  Science Rationale: There will be approximately 1300 inter-calibration opportunities with JPSS instruments (CERES or RBI and VIIRS) per year. The CPRSP needs to be capable of taking data for every opportunity.*  
- Verification Method: Analysis  
- Verification Description: LASP will analyze the pointing system of the CPRSP to make sure that the design supports the number of Inter-Calibration operations.
