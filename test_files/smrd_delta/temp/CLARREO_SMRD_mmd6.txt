## Order of Precedence ##

The Program-Level Requirements and Project-Level plans listed in the applicable documents section take precedence over the SMRD. The SMRD takes precedence over all lower level requirement documents. Nothing in this document, however, supersedes applicable laws and regulations.

# System Description [sec_desc] #

This section describes the system architecture for the CPF mission and provides context for requirements in `\autoref{sec_req}`{=latex}. Refer to CLARREO Pathfinder Mission Concept of Operations, CPF-02-009, for a more thorough description of the mission functions and operations.

## Mission Description ##

CLARREO is a Tier 1 mission recommended by the 2007 National Research Council Decadal Survey entitled "Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond." The foundation of CLARREO is the ability to produce highly accurate climate records to test climate projections in order to improve models and enable sound policy decisions. The CLARREO mission accomplishes this critical objective through accurate SI-traceable decadal observations that are sensitive to many of the key climate parameters such as radiative forcings, climate responses, and feedbacks.  Uncertainties in these parameters drive uncertainty in current climate model projections.  In 2016, the CLARREO Project received funding for a Pathfinder mission to demonstrate essential measurement technologies for the RS portions of the CLARREO Tier 1 Decadal survey mission, to include on-orbit high accuracy SI-traceable calibration and the ability to transfer that calibration to other on-orbit assets. The appropriated funds support the flight of an RS spectrometer hosted on the ISS in the calendar year 2022 time frame.  Prime mission operations on ISS are planned for one year, with an additional year of data analysis support following the end of the prime mission. 

CPF is a NASA-directed mission executed under the direction of the Science Mission Directorate – Earth Science Division. CPF is a Category 3 mission per NPR 7120.5E and a Class D payload risk classification per NPR 8705.4.  The mission has two baseline mission objectives:

1. Demonstrate the ability to conduct on-orbit, SI-traceable calibration of measured scene spectral reflectance, with an advance in accuracy over current on-orbit sensors; and 
2. Demonstrate the ability to use that improved accuracy to serve as an in orbit reference spectrometer for advanced inter-calibration of other key satellite sensors across most of the reflected solar spectrum (350 – 2300 nm). 

The CPF will advance the accuracy and inter-calibration of satellite sensors. New techniques and technologies, that when applied on future missions, can reduce the time, relative to the use of existing space-based observations of reflected solar wavelengths, needed to detect climate change trends using reflected solar earth remote sensing observations. It also serves to reduce the uncertainty in societally critical research areas such as climate sensitivity and cloud feedback.

## Science Objectives ##

The CPF science objectives, as defined in section 4.1.1 of the PRLA, are the following: 
1. Spectrally Resolved Earth Reflectance: The CPF objective is to acquire on-orbit SI-traceable spectrally resolved Earth reflectances referenced to spectral solar irradiance with average uncertainty <= 0.3% (k=1) for the 350 - 2300 nm wavelength range.
2. Spectrally Integrated Earth Reflectance: The CPF objective is to acquire on-orbit SI-traceable broadband (350 - 2300 nm) spectrally-integrated Earth reflectance with uncertainty <= 0.3% (k=1), with spectral accuracy weighted using global average Earth spectrally reflected energy.
3. On-Orbit Reference Inter-Calibration: The CPF objective is to demonstrate the ability to use the reflected solar spectrometer as an in-orbit transfer standard for intercalibration of the reflectance bands of the VIIRS instrument and the CERES or RBI instruments' shortwave channel. The inter-calibration uncertainties should be equal to or less than the spectrometer calibration uncertainties listed above.

## System Architecture ##

The CPF Project system architecture is composed of the four mission segments required to successfully measure, collect, analyze, and distribute the CPF science data. The CPF mission segments, as shown in `\autoref{cpf_arc}`{=latex} below and described in later sections are the Space Segment, Science Segment, Ground Segment, and Launch Segment. LASP is responsible for elements shown in yellow, while LaRC is responsible for elements shown in green. Elements shown in orange are external to the Project.

## Segment Definition ##

### Space Segment ###

The Space Segment is that portion of the architecture that flies in space and maintains the communication links between space and ground. It comprises the CPRSP and the ISS. The CPRSP, as shown in `\autoref{cprsp_fig}`{=latex}, consists of: the HySICS instrument, the HISIE, the HPS, and the ExPA, which is supplied by the ISS Program. The ISS comprises the orbiting Space Station, all of its crew, visiting vehicles, attached non-CLARREO Pathfinder payloads, and associated communications systems.
 
![CLARREO Pathfinder Reflected Solar Payload][cprsp_fig]

[cprsp_fig]: 20170614_cprsp_cad.pdf width="6.5in"

### Science Segment ###

The Science Segment includes all of the systems and facilities required to process, analyze (including calibration and validation of data), archive, and distribute the CPF science data and data products. The Science Segment consists of four elements: the CSDS at LASP, a NASA DAAC, the ICPP element at LaRC, and the Inter-Calibration Instruments. The Inter-Calibration Instruments are CERES, RBI, and VIIRS---the instruments specified by the On-Orbit Reference Inter-Calibration science objective. The NASA DAAC will make the data products listed in the Standard Science Data Products table publicly available in accordance with NASA Earth Science Data and Information Policy with no period of exclusive access.

### Ground Segment ###

The Ground Segment is the portion of the ground-based architecture that does not generate science products, and its primary role is to provide the monitoring, command, and control of the CPRSP. It also processes and forwards the data received from the Space Segment to the Science Segment. It comprises the CPOC at LASP, [>MCC-H] at JSC, and the POIC at MSFC.

### Launch Segment ###

The Launch Segment is responsible for preparing the CPRSP for flight and delivering it to the ISS. The Launch Processing portion of the architecture prepares the CPRSP, having completed final integration at KSC, to function as an ISS external payload. It includes the SSPF at KSC. Launch Vehicle Services is the portion of the architecture responsible for transporting the CPRSP from the Earth to the International Space Station. It comprises the LPF, Spacecraft, and Launch Vehicle. The LPF prepares and integrates the CPRSP into the Spacecraft and the Spacecraft into the Launch Vehicle. It then prepares the Launch Vehicle for flight. The Launch Vehicle and Spacecraft transport the CPRSP to the ISS. At this time, the identity of the Launch Vehicle Services provider and their associated requirements are not yet determined.

# Requirements [sec_req] #

`\renewcommand\labelitemi{}`{=latex}


This section contains technical requirements, which define either what CPF must do or a quality that the CPF must have. Science Requirements trace directly to PLRA Baseline Science Requirements and specify performance of the overall CPF mission. Mission Requirements allocate the SMRD Science Requirements and PLRA Mission and Flight Element Performance Requirements to the Project-managed elements. The SMRD groups Mission Requirements by segment. 
 
The SMRD distinguishes among requirements, goals, and statements of facts as follows:
- Shall: Used to indicate a binding requirement that will be verified
- Should/May: Used to indicate a desired goal
- Will: Used to indicate a statement of fact that the government will complete 

The SMRD allocates all Mission Requirements containing a "shall" to LASP-managed elements. Goals are non-binding, while statements of fact are binding in that an expectation of certainty is established. Goals are included to guide trade studies and will be addressed at design reviews and technical interchange meetings. Values in this document listed as TBD or TBR are pending confirmation.

### Launch Segment Requirements

The launch vehicle is provided by the ISS Program Office, and requirements for the launch vehicle are outside the scope of the CPF system. Requirements levied from the launch vehicle originate from `\TBD{Launch Vehicle Requirement Originator}`{=latex} and are allocated to each segment, element, and subsystem directly through the allocations made by LASP.
