# General Changes

- Reorganized science and mission requirements so that only mission requirements are allocated to LASP-delivered elements
- Rewrote last paragraph in 3.1 Mission Description to match recently-signed PLRA
- Rewrote section 4.0 Requirements to reflect reorganized requirements
- Rewrote requirement statements to ensure their grammatical subjects are the elements to which the requirements are allocated
- Corrected grammar, spelling, and diction

# Specific Changes to Science Requirements

## CPF.20004: Spectrally Resolved Earth Reflectance (requirement number change)

From: RS.21004  

To: **CPF.20004**

Rationale: Science requirements apply to the entire CLARREO Pathfinder, not just the CLARREO Pathfinder Reflected Solar Payload

## CPF.20005: Broadband Earth Reflectance (requirement number change)

From: RS.21005

To: **CPF.20005**

Rationale: Science requirements apply to the entire CLARREO Pathfinder, not just the CLARREO Pathfinder Reflected Solar Payload

## CPF.20050: Inter-Calibration Samples (requirement number change)

From: RS.21005  

To: **CPF.20050**

Rationale: Science requirements apply to the entire CLARREO Pathfinder, not just the CLARREO Pathfinder Reflected Solar Payload

# Specific Changes to Mission Requirements

## RS.21000: Wavelength

From: The CPRSP wavelength range for the instrument shall be 350 - 2300 nm.

To: The CPRSP **shall measure over** the **wavelength range of** 350-2300 nm.

Rationale: Allocated element is grammatical subject of requirement statement

## RS.21004: Spectrally Resolved Earth Reflectance

From: The **CLARREO Pathfinder** shall acquire on-orbit SI-traceable spectrally resolved Earth reflectances referenced to spectral solar irradiance with average uncertainty <= 0.3% (k=1) for the 350 - 2300 nm wavelength range.

To: The **CPRSP** shall acquire on-orbit SI-traceable spectrally resolved Earth reflectances referenced to spectral solar irradiance with average uncertainty <= 0.3% (k=1) for the 350 - 2300 nm wavelength range.

Rationale: Requirement now derived from CPF.20004 and allocated to CPRSP.

## RS.21005: Broadband Earth Reflectance

From: The **CLARREO Pathfinder** shall acquire on-orbit SI-traceable broadband reflectance (350 - 2300 nm) of Earth scenes with uncertainty <= 0.3% (k=1).

To: The **CPRSP** shall acquire on-orbit SI-traceable broadband reflectance (350 - 2300 nm) of Earth scenes with uncertainty <= 0.3% (k=1).

Rationale: Requirement now derived from CPF.20005 and allocated to CPRSP.

## SCI.24040: ESDIS Compliance

From: The CSDS Level 0 and Level 1B data products metadata shall conform to ISO 19115 Geographic Information - Metadata standards and adhere to the Metadata Requirements --- Base Reference for NASA Earth Science Data Products document published at http://earthdata.nasa.gov/about-eosdis/requirements. 

To: The CSDS **shall generate** Level 0 and Level 1B data products **whose metadata** conform to ISO 19115 Geographic Information - Metadata standards and adhere to the Metadata Requirements --- Base Reference for NASA Earth Science Data Products document published at http://earthdata.nasa.gov/about-eosdis/requirements. 

Rationale: Allocated element is grammatical subject of requirement statement

## SCI.24140: ESDIS Compliance

From: The ICPP Level 4 data products metadata will conform to ISO 19115 Geographic Information - Metadata standards and adhere to the Metadata Requirements --- Base Reference for NASA Earth Science Data Products document published at http://earthdata.nasa.gov/about-eosdis/requirements.

To: The ICPP **will generate** Level 4 data products **whose metadata** conform to ISO 19115 Geographic Information - Metadata standards and adhere to the Metadata Requirements --- Base Reference for NASA Earth Science Data Products document published at http://earthdata.nasa.gov/about-eosdis/requirements.

Rationale: Allocated element is grammatical subject of requirement statement

## GS.23000: POIC Interface

From: The CPOC interfaces with the ISS POIC shall comply with the CPOC to POIC ICD (TBD).

To: The CPOC **shall interface** with the ISS POIC **in accordance** with the CPOC to POIC ICD (TBD).

Rationale: Allocated element is grammatical subject of requirement statement

## GS.23060: Inter-Calibration Prioritization

New: **The CPOC shall command the CPRSP to execute a sufficient number of inter-calibration events to meet the performance measures specified in CPF.20050.**

Rationale: This is the inter-calibration science requirement (CPF.20050) allocated to the CPOC
